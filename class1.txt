Q. What is the purpose of learning programming language?
Ans: 
	to talk with computer
	s/w develop
	application

- different types of application we develop in java?

Network application: these application are used in client/ server environment.
	these are mainly used in Org. where data has to be referred / shared with others.
	eg: banking s/w
		insurance s/w

Web application: these application are used in internet 
	eg: All website(Web application)

Desktop application: these application are used in local system only.
	eg: Notepad, office, tools, .....
	Billing S/W

mobile application: These application are used in mobile.
	Ex: all mobile apps.

Device Application: these application are used for activation of electronic devices.
	Ex: Device Drivers.
to develop these all types of applications use java, dotnet..... are useful.


what is java?
it is a general purpose and object oriented programming language used to develop different types of applications. 

3 section in java
- core java - j2se - java 2 standard edition
	all the language funda's
- adv. Java - J2EE - Java 2 Enterprise edition 
	it is meant for developing application.
- J2ME - Java 2 Micro Edition
	it is meant for developing Mobile application

latest stable version of java: 21 LTS

all java update/s/w can be downloaded from Oracle

For learning any programming language:-
Tokens: variables, constants, keywords, operators.
Data Type:

------------------------------------------------------
# class 2


variables: It is named memory location to store values temply.
	these are having a facility to modify values whenever required.

rules for naming:- 
- name must be one word
- it should start with either alphabet / _ (underscore)
- name must have alphanumeric.

constants: These are one type of variable which will not allow to modify it's value once it is assigned.

keywords: These are the reserved words of the programming language which is having specific action/ meaning.

java has 50+ keywords: char, byte, int, short, double, long, float, if, else, while, for, case.

Data Type:- 
Primitive: provided by the programming language
	Number based: all the numbers can grouped by dividing into two parts
		Integer:- all the whole numbers
			keywords: byte, short, int, long
		decimal:- Numbers having decimal portion
			keywords: float, double
		
	Text bases: all character is called as text/string.
		these are 2 types:
		character: either single alphabet/ single digit/ single symbol
		characters enclosed in single quotes ('  ')
			keyword: char
		string:- Collection of characters
			values are enclosed in ("  ")

	Boolean: it allows us only 2 values true/ false
		keyword: boolean
		

Non Primitive (user defined): these are created and used by the developer
	keywords: enum, class, array, interface ......

download and install java
eclips idle


structure java:

importing package

class <Classname>
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
		body of the program
	}
}

---------------------------------------------------

class 3 notes
function is used to solve a task.
function is predefined world which has specific action. 
it predefined instruction to perform any task. 
these instruction will be written in a specific files called as library.

c, cpp library files are called as header files.
#inclued conio.h
#include stdio.h

in java these are called as package.

1. packages: these are the library files for the java
	usually a package is called as set of classes. and a class is consist of set of functions.

import "package name"

import java.io.*; //* represents all classes.
import java.io.Console; //import a specific class.

java.sql, java.lang, java.util ......

2. Every java program start with "class" and identified by a class name.

3. main():- the program execution starts with the main() method.

4. void:- it specify that main() is not returning any value.

5. static:- while calling a method to avoid object, than method starts with static.

6. public:- to access class members outside the class, we use public.

7. String[] args:- which explains in a concept of "command line arguments"l

once method/function is created, to get output of that function we have to call that function in other function. 
main() method will be called by the compiler.

output statements:
	System.out.println():- it is use to print statement / variable value line by line
	System.out.print():- it is use to print statement / variable value side by side.


notepad: first compile it (javac projectname.java)
	second just run the java program(java projectname.java)

Class 4
How to create a variable?
	<data type> <variable name> [=<value>]
		<...> = must be used 
		[...] = optional (may or may not)

	int x = 100; [right to left]
for every variable, following properties are existed.
	- Name
	- value
	- address
	- Capacity(min val - max value)
	- size of memory

	eg: int x = 100;
	float y = 12.45;
	char ch = 'A'

when ever you are using float data type use f at the end of the value. because it is treating it as double type.

How to create a constant variable?
	final <data type> <variable name> = <value>;
	
eg: final float pi= 3.14;


Operator:- there are the symbols which has some action b/w operands.

c=a+b
operand= the value on which operation is performed. (a,b,c)
operators= the symbol that is used to perform the operation (=, +)

Arithematic operator: these are used to perform mathemaical calculation.
+(add), -(minus), *(multiplicaion), /(division), %(div- remainder)

Relational Operators:  These are used to check the condition.
>,<,>=,<=,!=(not equals), ==(equals)
Note: the answer always going to be in bool value  (True/Fales)

Logical Operators: These are used b/w conditions when multiple conditions are checking.
Note: the answer always going to be in bool value  (True/Fales)
&& (AND): All condition must be true.
|| (OR):  any one condition must be true.
!  (NOT): if condition is true it returns false and vice versa.

AND Truth Table

A	B	R
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	F
F	F	F


OR Truth Table
A	B	R
T	T	T
T	F	T
F	T	T
F	F	F		

NOT truth table
A	R
T	F
F	T


Assignment Operators: These are used to assign value to the variable / results of expressions are also assigned variables.

=(Assigning values) +=, -=, /=, *=, %=

int x=10;
int y=20;

x=y // x and y are value 20
y=x // x and y are value 10

int z = x+y; // z value is 30

x=x+10; // mathematical equation
x+=10; // prog equation

Unary Operators: these are used to increase / decrease value by 1.
	++ increase / increment by 1
	-- decrease / decrement by 1
x = x+1 (or) x++ 
x = x-1 (or) x--

classified into 2 type
- pre increment: ++x (first increase/decrease then print)
- post increment: x-- (fist print then increase/decrease)

int x=10;
int y= x++;
sysout(y);
----------------------------------------
class 4

conditional operator: These are used to check conditions.
? :
	(<condition> ? <true>:<false>)

concatenation operator: these are used to concatenate any to stings or trying with other values.
+  = for concatenation two string 

JDK JVM and JRE

JDK = jvm + jre (combination of development tools and the set of library)

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
It will provide run time environment for java programs based on type of application.
	ie. provide library for the program

JVM: Java Virtual Machine
	it is an execution engine for java, it will take care entire program execution JVM basically consist of different operating systems to provide environment.

OS:
windows
Unix
Linux
mac os
android


Type casting or Type conversion:
the process of converting values from one data type to another data type.

two type of type casting
- implicit: here converting process will be taken from lower data type to higher data type.
	double -> long -> float -> int -> short -> byte

- explicit: here converting process with be taken from higher data type to lower data type.
	here we have to write addition statements to convert values.

how to input values dynamically:

Scanner Class: this class is used to input values into variable dynamically(at the time of program execution).

- import java.util.Scanner package at the top of the program.
- Create object for the scanner class as follows within the main()
	Scanner <object> = new Scanner(System.in)
	System.in => represents Keyboard.
- read values into different data type.
	byte = nextByte()
	short = nextShort()
int = nextInt()
long = nextLong()
float = nextFloat()
double = nextDouble()
char = nextCharacter()
String = next() / nextLine()
syntax
variable = object.methodName()

Calculate Area of circle : Area = PI*r*r
PI = 3.14  (use it as constant)
r that should be taken by user
